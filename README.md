Notes:
- The contact phone has been set to +4791281295.
- The questionnaire form is currently display-only. If you want it to send email or save submissions, I can add a mailto or serverless endpoint integration.
- If you prefer to keep the static marketing index.html instead of the React app, keep the existing index.html in the repo root and omit the Vite scaffold.
